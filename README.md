This is for my Lab 10: Build your CSUN Personal HTML Webpage


Instructions

In this lab assignment, you will create a minimalistic personal webpage, and you will upload it to ‎your CSUN personal WebDrive.‎
This web page should contain your portrait photo, your name (as a title), a short bio, your ‎education degrees information, your work experience, and your career interests. The page must ‎use HTML tags to show this information (i.e., you cannot just put a picture frame that contains ‎this same information -- everything except your personal picture must be HTML).

Style your HTML file by writing styling scripts in a separate CSS file that ‎you will include in your HTML file using the appropriate syntax as you learned from the tutorials‎.

After you created the basic HTML file and style, add a table containing the courses you have ‎taken this semester. Table headers (column titles, i.e. the first row) can be: ‎‎"Course Name" , "Section #" , "No. of Credits" , "Days of Class Meeting", and similar information. Use bold ‎font for the table headers and fill the table rows with the information about your courses.

Remember: Your styling scripts should go to your CSS file (instead of writing inline styling scripts in the HTML file.‎

You can look at the code for simple webpages – with no table ‎though – just to see how it can turn out, but what I want from you in this assignment is a very tiny ‎version of that.)‎

Sample pages to look at their source code (right-click on the page, and view the source code; or save the webpage and open it with a plaintext editor such as Notepad or Notepad++):

To begin, you can look at this tutorial:‎

There are several helpful resources in Week 13 materials for you.

A great reference for whatever you want to do, is the W3Schools that was introduced to you ‎earlier (in the Course Contents section for today's class session).‎

Once you created and uploaded the webpage(s) to your CSUN personal web space, write the URL to your webpage in the submission area.

OPTIONAL: You can use JavaScript as needed (or other technologies) to give your page a sense of ‎interactivity. You can also use different colors for fonts or as the page or table's background.‎
